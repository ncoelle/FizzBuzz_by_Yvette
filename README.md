# Getting Started with TDD in Swift
My take on the great tutorial from [Yvette Cook](https://medium.com/@ynzc?source=post_header_lockup):
[Getting Started with TDD in Swift 3](https://medium.com/@ynzc/getting-started-with-tdd-in-swift-2fab3e07204b)

I will use Swift 4 and try to commit after every green test.
